%%% commands %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% These DCG rules have the form command(g(Goal,Answer)) --> <sentence>
% The idea is that if :-phrase(command(g(Goal,Answer)),UtteranceList). succeeds,
% it will instantiate Goal; if :-call(Goal). succeeds, it will instantiate Answer.
% See case C. in prolexa.pl
% Example: 
%	command(g(random_fact(Fact),Fact)) --> [tell,me,anything].
% means that "tell me anything" will trigger the goal random_fact(Fact), 
% which will generate a random fact as output for prolexa.
